# CS 320 â€“ Module Eight Journal Reflection

## Portfolio Artifact Overview

This repository includes artifacts from Project One and Project Two for CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance. The following files demonstrate my ability to write unit tests, apply software testing strategies, and reflect on testing practices:

- `Contact.java`
- `ContactService.java`
- `ContactTest.java`
- `ContactServiceTest.java`
- `summary and reflections report.docx`

## Reflection

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure functionality, I apply unit testing and validation against all specified requirements. I use frameworks like JUnit to detect and fix errors early, and follow good coding practices like modular design, input validation, and secure exception handling to reduce vulnerabilities.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I analyze project requirements and translate them into precise software behaviors. For example, in Project One, I enforced constraints such as fixed-length IDs and phone numbers to meet user-defined input rules, ensuring the software behaved as expected.

### How do I approach designing software?

I design software by breaking the system into manageable parts, focusing on separation of concerns and testability. I use an iterative development process, writing and refining code alongside tests. This ensures that each component is well-structured and meets its intended functionality.
